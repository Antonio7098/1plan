# Sprint SPR-009 — Security & Compliance

Establish enterprise-grade security posture, compliance frameworks, and audit capabilities.

## Meta
- Sprint ID: SPR-009
- Status: planned
- Start date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- End date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Links: [Overview](./overview.md) · [PRD](../../planning/prd.md) · [Technical Overview](../../planning/technical-overview.md) · [Features CSV](../features.csv)

## Objectives (Tick when achieved)
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance implementation
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing baseline
- [ ] Secrets management and key rotation
- [ ] API security hardening (JWT, RBAC)
- [ ] Audit logging for compliance
- [ ] Data encryption validation

## Planned Tasks
- [ ] Implement GDPR data rights (access, deletion, portability)
- [ ] Set up secrets management (HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Configure JWT expiration and refresh token flow
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Add comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Security scanning integration (SAST/DAST)
- [ ] Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit validation
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms of service review
- [ ] Security incident response procedures

## Scope
In scope
- Security frameworks, compliance, audit logging
- Data protection and privacy rights implementation

Out of scope
- Advanced threat detection (future enhancement)
- SOC2 certification (requires operational history)

## Features in this Sprint
- [ ] FEAT-046 — Audit Logging & Compliance
- [ ] FEAT-047 — GDPR Compliance (Data Rights)
- [ ] FEAT-048 — Security Scanning (SAST DAST)
- [ ] FEAT-052 — SSO Integration (OIDC SAML)
- [ ] FEAT-045 — Input Sanitization & Validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GDPR data subject requests automated (access, deletion, portability)
- [ ] All API endpoints protected with proper authentication
- [ ] Secrets never stored in plain text or logs
- [ ] Security scan results show no high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Audit log captures all data access and modifications
- [ ] Penetration test report with remediation plan

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Compliance complexity · Mitigation: legal counsel review
- Risk: Performance impact of audit logging · Mitigation: async logging with batching
- Risk: Security vs usability trade-offs · Mitigation: UX review of security flows

## Dependencies
- Depends on: SPR-001 (API foundation), SPR-007 (auth foundation)
- Blocks: Production deployment, enterprise sales

## QA & Testing
- [ ] Security test suite covering OWASP Top 10
- [ ] Compliance verification tests
- [ ] Penetration testing by external security firm
- [ ] Data encryption verification tests

## Technical Details

### Database Models
- Collections/Tables impacted: User, AuditLog, DataRequest, Session
- New/changed fields: User(dataProcessingConsent, lastLogin), AuditLog(userId, action, resource, timestamp, ipAddress), DataRequest(userId, type, status, requestedAt, fulfilledAt)
- Constraints/validation: AuditLog retention policy; DataRequest SLA tracking
- Indexes (read/write paths): AuditLog by userId, timestamp; DataRequest by userId, status
- Migrations: add audit and compliance tables — Backfill plan: historical audit log not required for MVP
- Data retention: AuditLog 7 years; DataRequest 3 years; User data per GDPR requirements

## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] GDPR Article 15 (Right of Access) implemented
- [ ] GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure) implemented
- [ ] GDPR Article 20 (Data Portability) implemented
- [ ] GDPR Article 32 (Security of Processing) validated
- [ ] Privacy by Design principles applied
- [ ] Data Processing Impact Assessment (DPIA) completed
- [ ] Data retention policies documented and enforced
- [ ] Cross-border data transfer safeguards implemented
