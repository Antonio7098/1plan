# Sprint SPR-010 — Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

Implement comprehensive disaster recovery, backup strategies, and business continuity procedures for enterprise resilience.

## Meta
- Sprint ID: SPR-010
- Status: planned
- Start date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- End date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Links: [Overview](./overview.md) · [PRD](../../planning/prd.md) · [Technical Overview](../../planning/technical-overview.md) · [Features CSV](../features.csv)

## Objectives (Tick when achieved)
- [ ] Automated backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Multi-region deployment capability
- [ ] RTO/RPO definitions and testing
- [ ] Incident response playbooks
- [ ] Service degradation modes
- [ ] Business continuity documentation

## Planned Tasks
- [ ] Implement automated database backups (daily, weekly, monthly)
- [ ] Set up cross-region backup replication
- [ ] Create database failover procedures and testing
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation modes
- [ ] Document RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- [ ] Create incident response playbooks and escalation procedures
- [ ] Set up monitoring for backup integrity
- [ ] Implement disaster recovery testing schedule
- [ ] Document business continuity procedures
- [ ] Create emergency contact procedures

## Scope
In scope
- Backup/restore automation, failover procedures, incident response
- Multi-region deployment preparation

Out of scope
- Active-active multi-region (complex for MVP)
- Advanced chaos engineering (covered in testing)

## Features in this Sprint
- [ ] FEAT-049 — Disaster Recovery Procedures
- [ ] FEAT-050 — Multi-Region Deployment
- [ ] FEAT-029 — Backup/Restore Scripts (DB) [enhanced]
- [ ] FEAT-041 — Graceful Shutdown Handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database backup/restore tested and documented (< 1 hour RTO)
- [ ] Cross-region failover procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Incident response playbook covers all critical scenarios
- [ ] Backup integrity monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Business continuity plan approved by stakeholders
- [ ] DR testing schedule established and first test completed

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Data loss during failover · Mitigation: automated backup verification
- Risk: Long recovery times · Mitigation: hot standby and read replicas
- Risk: Incomplete incident procedures · Mitigation: regular DR drills

## Dependencies
- Depends on: SPR-004 (monitoring), SPR-006 (testing framework)
- Blocks: Enterprise SLA commitments, production scaling

## QA & Testing
- [ ] Disaster recovery drill (full system restore)
- [ ] Backup integrity verification tests
- [ ] Failover time measurement and optimization
- [ ] Incident response simulation exercises

## Technical Details

### Database Models
- Collections/Tables impacted: BackupLog, IncidentLog, SystemHealth
- New/changed fields: BackupLog(backupId, type, status, size, duration, checksum), IncidentLog(incidentId, severity, status, startTime, resolvedTime, impact), SystemHealth(component, status, lastCheck, responseTime)
- Constraints/validation: BackupLog retention policy; IncidentLog severity levels; SystemHealth status enum
- Indexes (read/write paths): BackupLog by timestamp, status; IncidentLog by severity, status; SystemHealth by component, timestamp
- Migrations: add operational monitoring tables — Backfill plan: historical data not required
- Data retention: BackupLog 1 year; IncidentLog 3 years; SystemHealth 90 days

## Disaster Recovery Procedures

### RTO/RPO Targets
- **Database Recovery**: RTO 1 hour, RPO 15 minutes
- **Application Recovery**: RTO 30 minutes, RPO 5 minutes
- **Full System Recovery**: RTO 2 hours, RPO 1 hour

### Backup Strategy
- **Database**: Automated daily full backup, hourly incremental
- **Application Code**: Git repository with tagged releases
- **Configuration**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with version control
- **Monitoring Data**: 90-day retention with export capability

### Incident Response Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: System down, data loss risk - 15 min response
- **P1 (High)**: Major feature down, performance degraded - 1 hour response
- **P2 (Medium)**: Minor feature issues - 4 hour response
- **P3 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, documentation - 24 hour response

### Business Continuity Checklist
- [ ] Emergency contact list maintained and tested
- [ ] Alternative communication channels established
- [ ] Key personnel backup assignments documented
- [ ] Vendor escalation procedures documented
- [ ] Customer communication templates prepared
- [ ] Financial impact assessment procedures
- [ ] Legal and regulatory notification requirements
- [ ] Post-incident review and improvement process
