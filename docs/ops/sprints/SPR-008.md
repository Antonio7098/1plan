## Meta
- Sprint ID: SPR-008
- Status: planned
- Start date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- End date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Links: [Overview](./overview.md) · [PRD](../../planning/prd.md) · [Technical Overview](../../planning/technical-overview.md) · [Features CSV](../features.csv)

## Objectives (Tick when achieved)

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure GitHub Pages for OpenAPI docs deployment
- [ ] Prepare v1.0 release notes and changelog
- [ ] Test full end-to-end flow in clean environment

## Scope
In scope
- Demo assets, packaging, release automation
- Documentation polish and integration guides

Out of scope
- New features (focus on existing functionality)
- Performance optimization beyond basic requirements

## Features in this Sprint
- [ ] FEAT-032 — Docs: README Contributing OpenAPI [polish]
- [ ] FEAT-027 — Dockerfile & Docker Compose [complete]
- [ ] FEAT-026 — CI Workflow (GitHub Actions) [complete]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Demo GIF shows complete agent workflow (create project → edit docs)
- [ ] `docker-compose up` works from scratch with seeded data
- [ ] MCP integration guide includes Claude Desktop + Cursor examples
- [ ] CI pipeline runs tests, lint, build, and deploys docs

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Demo complexity · Mitigation: simple, focused 30-second workflow
- Risk: Docker environment issues · Mitigation: test on multiple platforms
- Risk: Documentation gaps · Mitigation: external review before release

## Dependencies
- Depends on: SPR-001 through SPR-007 (core functionality complete)
- Blocks: Public launch and community adoption

## QA & Testing
- [ ] End-to-end smoke test in Docker environment
- [ ] MCP integration tested with multiple clients
- [ ] Documentation review by external user
- [ ] Release artifacts tested on clean systems

## Launch Checklist
- [ ] Polish README with demo GIF
- [ ] Docker setup working end-to-end
- [ ] MCP integration examples (Claude Desktop config)
- [ ] CI green (tests, lint, build)
- [ ] GitHub Pages with API docs
- [ ] v1.0 release with changelog
- [ ] GitHub topics and description updated
